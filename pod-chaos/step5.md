## Pod-failure Experiment
In this experiment, we are going to make a certain pod unavailable for a period of time, eg: 120 seconds.
When we call a certain pod unavailable, we are saying that a certain pod is unable to perform its duty, for example, responding to HTTP requests.

Pod-failure Chaos experiment would change the image of each container in the target Pod to the `pause image`, which is a special image that does not perform any operations. But this wouldn't cause any problem if the container is configured without `command`, `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`: the container would be inspected as Running and Ready, even its image has been updated to `pause`. In this experiment, we configured a `liveness probe`.

Here is the YAML we use to deploy a pod-failure experiment.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-failure-example
  # namespace: chaos-testing
spec:
  action: pod-failure
  mode: one
  duration: '180s'
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      'app': 'buddy-service'
```{{copy}}

Before the experiment, you can run `curl localhost:8082/buddy/list`{{execute}} to get the output of our application to get a available pods' ip list.

After deploying this experiment by run `kubectl apply -f pod-failure.yaml`{{execute}}, you can expect that one of the pods has been injected and its image has been updated to `pause`. It would need several minutes before the experiment applies and hopefully the pod status would be `CrashLoopBackOff`.

To help you check the pod status, run `wait-failure.sh`{{execute}} and then run `kubectl get pods`{{execute}} to check the status.

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                     READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-lrxjb   1/1     Running            0          3m5s
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-nlr5c   1/1     Running            0          3m5s
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-zgnq8   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   4          3m5s
```
You can check this via our application: [here]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8082}}/buddy/list) 
And you will find that there are only two IPs left, which was three at the beginning.

For your convenienve, you can run `curl localhost:8082/buddy/list`{{execute}} instead to get the output of our application.

After the experiment finished, which is set via `duration: 180s`  in the yaml, you will find that the pod resume and three IPs are shown in the web application. 

run `curl localhost:8082/buddy/list`{{execute}} to get the output of our application.

If you try to run `kubectl get pods`{{execute}}, you would see a similiar output

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-lrxjb   1/1     Running   0          4m14s
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-nlr5c   1/1     Running   0          4m14s
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-zgnq8   1/1     Running   5          4m14s
```

Cool! You have finished this experiment and you can explore more about thi s on the offical document website.

#### clear the experiment

the experiment can be easily removed via `kubectl delete -f pod-failure.yaml`{{execute}}
