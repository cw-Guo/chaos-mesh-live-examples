### Pod-kill Example
Before we start the next experiment, you may need to reset the kubernete's port forward policy to avoid any application network problems. Run `reset-network.sh`{{execute}}

Based on this example, Chaos Mesh injects pod-kill into the specified Pod and kills the Pod once.

Before we start the experiment, you can go to our application and note down the three IPs listed there.
For your convenienve, you can run `curl localhost:8082/buddy/list`{{execute}} instead to get the output of our application.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-kill-example
  # namespace: chaos-testing
spec:
  action: pod-kill
  mode: one
  selector:
    # namespaces:
    #   - tidb-cluster-demo
    labelSelectors:
      'app': 'buddy-service'
```{{copy}}

If you run `kubectl apply -f pod-kill.yaml`{{execute}}, you will find that a pod has been restarted.
Run `kubectl get pods`{{execute}}, the following output will show up.
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-hgr77   1/1     Running   0          2m10s
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-k5mpt   1/1     Running   0          7s
buddy-list-deployment-6d756fb8cf-nlr5c   1/1     Running   0          10m
```

One of the pod's age would be pretty new and it's because our pod-kill experiment kill the old image, and the deployment's replica policy will always make sure that there are 3 replicas available, therefore, a new pod is created.

And if you go back to the web application, you will find that the one of the IPs has been updated.

run `curl localhost:8082/buddy/list`{{execute}} to get the output of our application.

#### clear the experiment

the experiment can be easily removed via `kubectl delete -f pod-kill.yaml`{{execute}}
